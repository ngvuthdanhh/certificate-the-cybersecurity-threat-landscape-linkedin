# Project: Network Hardening

## Objective
Strengthen the security posture of a sample enterprise network.

## Tasks
1. Review a provided network diagram with exposed weaknesses.  
2. Apply defense strategies: patching, segmentation, firewall rules, IDS/IPS placement.  
3. Implement access control principles (least privilege, MFA).  
4. Document changes in a **before-and-after comparison**.  

## Deliverables
- Updated network security architecture diagram.  
- Documentation of applied security controls.  

## Key Learning
Hands-on practice with **defense-in-depth** and network security best practices.
