# Lab: Network Vulnerability Exploration

## Objective
Understand how attackers exploit weak points in a network and how to mitigate them.

## Steps
1. Review a sample network diagram.  
2. Identify vulnerable points (open ports, outdated software, weak passwords).  
3. Simulate attacker behavior (scanning and reconnaissance).  
4. Suggest hardening techniques (patching, firewalls, access control).  

## Deliverables
- A vulnerability map of the sample network.  
- Mitigation recommendations.  

## Key Learning
Knowing where a system is weak is the first step toward **effective defense**.
