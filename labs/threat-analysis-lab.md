# Lab: Threat Analysis

## Objective
Analyze different types of threats and understand how to classify them based on severity, likelihood, and potential impact.

## Steps
1. Review case studies of recent cyberattacks.  
2. Identify whether they are malware, phishing, insider threats, or APTs.  
3. Map the threats to the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).  
4. Assess risk level using a simple **risk matrix**.  

## Deliverables
- A threat classification table.  
- Risk assessment summary for each case.  

## Key Learning
Threat analysis helps organizations **prioritize resources** and address the most critical risks first.
