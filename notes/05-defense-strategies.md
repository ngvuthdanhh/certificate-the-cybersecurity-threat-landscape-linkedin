# Defense Strategies

Organizations must adopt a **layered defense approach** to reduce risk.  

### Core Defenses
- **Defense-in-Depth**: Multiple layers of security (network, application, endpoint, human).  
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify; assume breach.  
- **Threat Intelligence**: Using real-time data to anticipate and mitigate attacks.  
- **Incident Response**: Structured process for detection, containment, and recovery.  

### Key Takeaways
- Cybersecurity must balance **prevention, detection, and response**.  
- People, processes, and technology must all align to build resilience.
