# Attack Vectors

Attack vectors are the methods or pathways adversaries use to exploit vulnerabilities.  

### Common Vectors
- **Email**: Phishing, malicious attachments, business email compromise.  
- **Web**: Drive-by downloads, malicious scripts, watering-hole attacks.  
- **Mobile**: Malicious apps, SIM swapping, SMS phishing (smishing).  
- **IoT**: Poorly secured devices exploited for botnets and surveillance.  
- **Cloud**: Misconfigurations, credential theft, supply chain risk.  

### Key Takeaways
- Attackers adapt quickly to new technologies.  
- The **attack surface expands** with digital transformation and remote work.
